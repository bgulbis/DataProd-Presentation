The Issue
========================================================

Recent events have revealed some auto manufacturers have manipulated the results of tests which determine a vehicle's posted fuel efficiency. 

Given a lack of trust in manufacturers, consumers may want an independent way to estimate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle they wish to purchase.

Prediction Model
========================================================

This simple app can predict a vehicle's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon), using only two characteristics of the vehicle:

- Horsepower
- Weight (in tons)

How it Works
========================================================

Based upon the `mtcars` data set, a linear regression was used to predict the change in a vehicle's fuel efficiency as the horsepower or weight are changed.

A web-based app was then developed to
